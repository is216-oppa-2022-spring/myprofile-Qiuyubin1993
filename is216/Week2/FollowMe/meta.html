        Without a viewport meta tag, mobile devices render pages at typical desktop screen widths 
        and then scale the pages down, making them difficult to read. 
        Setting the viewport meta tag lets you control the width and scaling of the viewport 
        so that it's sized correctly on all devices.
        
        We will talk about this more in Week 3 (CSS - Bootstrap) onwards
